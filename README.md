<p>This is my solution to the CS50 "Runoff" problem set, implemented in C. You can find the full problem description <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/3/runoff/">here</a>.</p>
Problem Overview
<p>In this problem set, I implemented a program that simulates a runoff election. A runoff election allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate has more than 50% of the votes after the first round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and votes for that candidate are redistributed according to voters’ preferences. This process continues until one candidate has more than 50% of the votes.</p> <p>This solution was completed as part of <strong>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</strong>.

Program Structure
<ul> <li><strong>Input</strong>: The program takes candidates' names as command-line arguments and allows voters to rank their preferences by typing the names of the candidates.</li> <li><strong>Vote Recording</strong>: The program records each voter's ranked preferences.</li> <li><strong>Elimination Process</strong>: If no candidate wins an outright majority, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the votes for that candidate are redistributed.</li> <li><strong>Winner Determination</strong>: The process continues until a candidate wins more than 50% of the votes.</li> </ul>
Key Steps:
<ol> <li><strong>Command-line Input</strong>: The program accepts command-line arguments representing the candidates' names.</li> <li><strong>Ranked Voting</strong>: Voters are prompted to rank their candidates by preference, and these preferences are stored in an array.</li> <li><strong>Vote Tally</strong>: The program counts the first-choice votes for each candidate. If no candidate has more than 50%, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the process is repeated with remaining candidates.</li> <li><strong>Elimination and Redistribution</strong>: Votes are redistributed to remaining candidates according to the voter's next preference once a candidate is eliminated.</li> <li><strong>Print Winner</strong>: When one candidate has more than 50% of the votes, the program prints the winner’s name and exits.</li> </ol> <p>Note: This repository does not include any files provided by CS50, such as the Makefile or sample input files.</p>
